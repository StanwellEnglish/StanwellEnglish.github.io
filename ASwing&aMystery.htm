<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Mrs McCarthy had been
looking forward to a quiet lunchtime. She was usually not a stressed person,
but her pupils had given her a morning that would have tried anyone’s patience.
It had rained throughout, and her class had been intense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>First there had been
Felix Duncan, who had heard the Crazy Frog song for the first time over the
weekend and kept singing it at his classmates until they told him to stop, and
then sang it even louder. Then there was Summer Jones, who had been in one of
her haughty moods and managed to argue with three of her classmates over the
course of three lessons. Perhaps most irritatingly of all, Miss Haq from the
class next door was off sick, and all morning she had had to keep popping in to
remind the Year 5’s to be nice to the supply teacher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>But now, having collected
her lunch from the staffroom and having extricated herself from a long-winded
conversation with the caretaker, Mrs McCarthy had twenty whole minutes to enjoy
a quiet cup of tea and the sandwich that she had made herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>All was serenity, all was
peace, until Mrs McCarthy raised the sandwich to her mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“Miss! Miss!” came a
voice from the corridor outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Mrs McCarthy exhaled deeply
and put down her sandwich with a bubbling fury. She was irritated at being
called ‘Miss’. She was in her mid-fifties, and hadn’t been a Miss since 2003.
She was piqued by having one of her pupils standing in the corridor shouting.
She was incensed about being disturbed during her lunchtime, when she wasn’t
even on duty. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>She opened the door to
see a teary and red-faced Summer Jones. Mrs McCarthy’s temper melted almost
immediately. No matter how many interruptions she’d faced today she just
couldn’t get angry at a crying child. It was how she’d managed to stay a
primary school teacher for so long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Summer was doubled over,
holding her knee in pain. A fall, Mrs McCarthy assumed, probably from the
swings. She had told the pupils not to use the outdoor equipment after the
heavy rain, but of course they’d used it anyway. Mrs McCarthy lowered herself
to speak to the sobbing Summer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“Let me look,” Mrs
McCarthy said, patiently. Summer removed her hand. It was covered in blood. Summer’s
knee was covered in a nasty gash. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Mrs McCarthy made a quick
examination. “It looks worse than it is,” she said, trying to give Summer a
smile. “Don’t panic.” She went to the first aid cupboard, fetched a large
plaster and disinfectant spray. She began to treat Summer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“Now, how did this
happen?” she asked the girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“I was pushed,” the girl
responded through tears, “off the swings.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Mrs McCarthy wasn’t sure
if Summer was lying. “Pushed? Are you sure? You didn’t just fall?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“No Miss,” Summer said,
“I was pushed from behind.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“By a group of people?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“No, just one. They
pushed me off and then ran away. Everyone else was queuing for the slide. Or
still in the lunch hall.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>“Did you see who?” Mrs
McCarthy asked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Summer shook her head.
“They ran away.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>As Mrs McCarthy pasted
the plaster, she considered. As sweet as she looked, Summer wasn’t always a
well-behaved child. That morning she had been told off for saying malicious things
to three different pupils. Each of the three had left the class red-faced and
embarrassed. They all had a reason to be angry at Summer and were all at lunch
at the same time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Mrs McCarthy thought
about the three suspects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Magnus Winston was a
quiet boy. He’d spend his lunchtimes playing chess, usually against himself.
There were picnic benches near the swings where he’d sometimes play chess on a
dry day. Otherwise, he’d be in the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Saffiya Patel was a
natural show-off, who loved to exhibit her dancing and gymnastics skills,
whether that was hanging upside down from the slide, or leaping off the picnic
tables. She could always be found where the biggest crowd was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Lucie Barnes was a force
of nature. She had no patience and hated sitting still or standing in lines.
She spent most of her lunchtime alternately racing around the playground,
playing games that involved hitting things with sticks, or using the school
buildings for parkour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>When Mrs McCarthy asked
the three pupils, all of them denied they’d pushed Summer. But they also
promised they hadn’t seen the other two. This meant that one of them was at
each location. Anyone coming from the slide or hall would have been obvious to
Summer. If she was pushed from behind, it had to be from the picnic benches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Mrs McCarthy knew the
identity of the person who had attacked Summer. Do you?</span></i></p>
