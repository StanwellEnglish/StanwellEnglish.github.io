style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice
and the Haystack</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice had
been wandering the open countryside for what felt like hours, when she came to
a wheatfield which had been freshly harvested. But all of the hay appeared to
have been piled up in one corner by the road, so that Alice was dwarfed by a
colossal haystack the height of a streetlamp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>As she
looked up at the enormous pile of hay, she heard sobbing. She walked around the
base of the haystack, until she found a woman in a dusty red dress weeping into
her apron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>With red
and swollen eyes, the woman looked up as Alice approached. "Oh, it's no
good. I shall never find it!" she sniffled, dabbing at her nose with a
corner of her dress. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice's
eyes grew wide. "What is it?" she asked, her voice filled with
concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>The woman
took a deep, shuddering breath. "My sewing needle," she said, her
voice cracking with despair. "I'm a dressmaker, you see, and without it, I
cannot make a single stitch!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice
wanted to be as helpful as she could, so she was about to ask, "Wherever
did you lose it?" but then remembered that whenever her own mother asked
her this, it made her fly into a rage. If she'd known where she lost something,
it wouldn't be lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"It's
lost in this haystack!" the woman told Alice, weeping again. "Oh, I
shall never find it, even with all the help."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice was
wondering what the woman meant by help, but her thoughts were disturbed by a
sudden blast from a bugle, coming from the top of the haystack. Alice looke up
to see, half buried in the hay, a cockerel standing to attention, blowing into
a horn that rang out loud and long across the fields.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"That's
the end of day call," said the dressmaker. "It's time for all the
animals to show what they've found. Oh I do hope they ve found my needle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>The
haystack began to make all sorts of noises, including muffled sound of barks,
squeaks, and the occasional roar of laughter. Some sort of creatures were
moving deep within the hay. Suddenly Alice saw, scurrying out from the bottom
of the hay a tiny mole, who was wearing spectacles almost as large as its whole
body. "No luck today," she said. "Try again tomorrow."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Not
so fast!" cried another voice, and the head of a ferret popped out.
"I've found it, I've found it!" he said. With another wriggle, the
ferret's whole body came through, and Alice saw that rather than a needle, he
was proudly holding up his own tail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"That's
your tail again," said the dressmaker, glumly. "You need to be
careful you don't pull it off." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Needn't
worry about that," the effervescent ferret chuckled, "if I pulled it
off, you could always sew it back on for me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"No, I
couldn't!" blubbed the dressmaker, "I don't have my needle!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"But
surely you have more than one? And if not, couldn't you just make another
needle?" Alice asked, again only trying to be helpful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"And
how would you go about doing that then?" the Ferret queried, his eyebrow
raised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Well,
you just..." began Alice, and then realised that she didn't have the first
idea how needles were actually made. Presumably there was some large factory
out there that made only needles, or perhaps it did both needles and other
sorts of pins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Before she
could get much further with her reasoning, a trio of animals bundled up in a
ball sprang from the top of the haystack. With a mix of yowls and barks they
almost knocked the cockerel from his perch. They landed on the ground,
unfolding into two ferocious bloodhounds and an exhausted looking fox. The
ferret leapt between the dogs and the fox to separate their squabble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"I've
told you hounds before," said the ferret, "No fox hunting in the
haystack!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"But
we're not in the haystack," one of the hounds said, grinning and looking
at the fox with eager eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Cut
it out," ordered the ferret, who seemed to be in charge. "That fox is
the only reason we've made any progress at all."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice
brightened at this. "You've made progress?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Oh
yes," said the ferret, returning to his smile. "We've found something
almost every day we ve been looking. Look!" He gestured towards the fence,
where there was a motley collection of objects: a bicycle, the remnants of a
scarecrow, some sort of rod, a euphonium and a false leg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"You
found all of these in the haystack?" asked Alice, wondering how some of
the things could have ended up all together in the stack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Not
to mention this bugle," called the cockerel in his faint voice from the
top of the haystack. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"But
no needle," wailed the dressmaker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>Alice
looked at the menagerie of assistants the dressmaker had helping her, then at
the odd objects they had all found. A thought came to her. "Do any of you
actually know what a needle looks like?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>There was a
pause. The animals began to look around, hoping someone else would answer
first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Well,
it's..." began one of the hounds, "it's like..."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"No,"
interrupted the other, "it's nothing like that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"No,"
replied the first hound, his face falling. "I suppose it's not."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"I can
help look if you like," Alice suggested, though she had no idea where to
begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"Help
look?" exclaimed the ferret indignantly. "But the end-of-day bugle
has called! If you start looking now, you'll mess up our whole system!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Tw Cen MT",sans-serif'>"I'm
not sure the system has been terribly successful..." Alice began, but the
creatures had already begun haughtily sticking their noses in the air, and
walking away from her, the haystack and the wailing lady.</span></p>
