<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:130%'>Year 8 Homework – Week 2</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><img width=278 height=291

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Detective Sullivan was an unusual guest at Big Frankie’s
Speakeasy. In this part of town, no crime occurred without Big Frankie Perini
knowing about it and receiving a cut of the profits. He was the most notorious
mobster north of the river. If a robbery occurred, the money was going to Big
Frankie. If a murder happened, it was on Big Frankie’s say-so. If a kid even
dared to let off a firework, it was because Uncle Big Frankie said it was okay.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>But Frankie was never caught. He was clever. He’d bribed
everyone from the mayor down and no police officer dared to enter his domain.
Except today, Detective Sullivan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>He’d walked into the empty bar that morning with as much
bravado as he could muster, and announced to the old-timer washing glasses that
he was here to see the boss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;You got guts, coming in here, copper,&quot; the man had
said, as he led him to the backroom. He didn’t even try to hide the crates of
illegal hooch that had been delivered under cover of night. &quot;But I guess
you know that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Whilst the bar was rough, the back room was the realm of a
well-to-do gentleman, the walls lined with bookshelves filled with
leather-bound tomes, illuminated by a sparkling chandelier. Beneath it, a long
table was surrounded by five men, all with the same cold, assessing gaze as the
one who had let him in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie Perini sat at the head, his fingers steepled. He
looked up as Sullivan entered, his expression unreadable. &quot;Detective
Sullivan,” he said. “Chicago’s finest. To what do I owe the pleasure of this...
unorthodox visit?&quot; His voice was smooth, cultured, a stark contrast to the
thugs that flanked him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Sullivan took a seat, his eyes sweeping the room before
settling back on Big Frankie. &quot;Perini. You know everything that goes on in
this part of town,&quot; he told the mobster. &quot;Or your goons do,
anyhow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie leaned back in his chair, his gaze never leaving
the detective. &quot;Maybe. But there are things we know we may not be inclined
to share with a detective.&quot; His smile was like a knife edge, sharp and
threatening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;I think this may be a rare exception,&quot; Sullivan
said, his voice even.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself.
&quot;And why would that be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;I've just come from the infirmary. Would you happen to
know Mrs Moskowitz?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>A ripple of shock ran around the room. Everyone knew Mrs
Moskowitz. Was she in trouble with the law?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;She taught my daughter to read,&quot; said one of Big
Frankie's heavies, “What happened to her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Hell, she taught me to read,&quot; chimed in another.
&quot;She's a saint. You better not have done anything to her, copper.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>“Easy,” breathed Big Frankie. “The detective didn’t hurt her.
If he did, he wouldn’t be here, because he knows he wouldn’t ever leave here.
What happened, Sullivan?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Some low-life mugged her last night,&quot; Sullivan
said, his eyes boring into Big Frankie's. &quot;Took her purse, knocked her
down. Broke her arm in the process.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie's smile disappeared, replaced by a scowl. &quot;What
is the world coming to?&quot; he said, his voice controlled. His men shifted in
their chairs, their knuckles whitening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;I figured you'd feel that way,&quot; Sullivan said.
&quot;Which is why I'm here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie leaned forward, his elbows on the table. &quot;I
see detective. Well, you rest assured, between us we will find out who hurt
that little old lady. And their life won't be worth living.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Sullivan's jaw tightened. He did not intend to encourage the
mobsters to take the law into their own hands. &quot;Sorry, Perini. I want this
done by the book. I want this scumbag in a jail cell, not at the bottom of the
Chicago River.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie's eyes narrowed. &quot;Our way gets results,
detective. Why should we, of all people, help you do it your way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;My mother was Mrs. Moskowitz's best friend,&quot;
Sullivan said, his voice low and steady. &quot;I want to handle this
personally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie leaned back, stroking his chin thoughtfully. He
understood family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;I just need a name,&quot; Sullivan pressed.
&quot;Someone who would be bold enough to attack a defenceless woman like
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie's gaze swept the table, and his men looked at
their hands, at the floor, anywhere but at the detective's eyes. The tension in
the room grew as thick as the smoke from their cigarettes. Finally, a name
bubbled to the surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Could be Vincent Marconi,&quot; one of the men
murmured. &quot;He's a young kid trying to make a name for himself. No moral
compass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Or maybe it's Paul O'Malley,&quot; said another,
&quot;He's always had a nasty streak.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;How about the new guy, what's his name, Vincenzo
Gallucci?&quot; another of the henchmen suggested, a hint of malice in his
voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Or could it be Sean McCarthy? You remember what he did
to his mother. No respect.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>“Jack Baxter. No gang’d take him. Pure scum. I’d bet my life
on it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>The names tumbled out like a deck of cards thrown across the
table, each one more unsavoury than the last. Sullivan had to agree, it was
most likely one of the five names the men had suggested. Did any of these men
genuinely know which one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Enough,&quot; Big Frankie barked, his voice slicing
through the murmurs like a hot knife through butter. The room fell silent, and
the men straightened in their seats. &quot;Detective, give us a moment alone,
and I will consider if I can help you further.&quot; His tone was a mix of
respect and authority, leaving no room for argument.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Sullivan left and stood outside the door for two minutes. The
voices were hushed but he could tell there was argument. Eventually, the men
seemed to come to some accord. A tall henchman came to open the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>&quot;Big Frankie will see you now,&quot; he said, his eyes
devoid of expression. Sullivan stepped back into the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie sat at the head of the table, a small smile on
his face. &quot;We have amongst us been able to establish the culprit,
Detective,&quot; he began. &quot;But, if word gets out that I'm handing over my
associates to the cops...&quot; He let the sentence hang in the air,
unfinished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Sullivan nodded slowly. &quot;I get it. But I think you have
a little more to say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Big Frankie’s eyes drifted to the window. &quot;I can give
you a clue,&quot; he said after a moment's pause. “If you’re prepared to do a
little walking you may help establish the alibis of some of these gentlemen.
Start by progressing from here to Macy’s Deli to see what the folks there have
to say. Then you’ll want to check out the Irish place on Green Street. You’ll
find a little more information waiting for you at Dr Madison’s surgery. And
whilst you’re there by the way, I’d pick up some apple pie from Rebecci and Co.
Finally, you can head back to your own police precinct satisfied with your
results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>Sullivan was at first bewildered by this set of instructions,
but reaching for his inner pocket he found his map of downtown Chicago, and Big
Frankie’s advice fell into place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:130%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:130%'>“Thank you, Perini,” he said, tipping his hat to the mobster.
He only had one place he needed to go. He left directly to arrest the one true
culprit.</span></p>
